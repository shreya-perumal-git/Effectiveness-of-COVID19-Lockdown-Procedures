# Effectiveness of COVID-19 Lockdown Procedures

This project analyzes the impact of Ontario’s COVID-19 lockdown measures on virus transmission using public health data (April 2020–August 2021) and a Python-based SIR model. By normalizing case data and simulating infection trends, we compared real outcomes against model predictions. Findings show that lockdowns, particularly stay-at-home orders, effectively reduced transmission rates by lowering encounter rates, while reopening phases led to sharp increases in infections. Despite model limitations, results confirm that strict interventions significantly slowed the spread of COVID-19.
